Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

Description
-----------

This course will survey the conditions of material life and changing social and economic conditions in medieval Europe with reference to the comparative context of contemporary Islamic, Chinese, and central Asian experiences. Subject covers the emergence and decline of feudal institutions, the transformation of peasant agriculture, living standards and the course of epidemic disease, and the ebb and flow of long- distance trade across the Eurasian system. Particular emphasis will be placed on the study of those factors, both institutional and technological, which have contributed to the emergence of capitalist organization and economic growth in Western Europe in contrast to the trajectories followed by the other major medieval economies.

CI-H Requirement
----------------

This course offers credit for the CI-H requirement and will strongly emphasize the teaching of expository and analytical writing as utilized by historians for the dissemination of their scholarly findings. Each student will be expected to write a number of short discussion papers, and two substantive essays (6 pages each) over the course of the term. Students will also give a short oral presentation of their intended thesis statement and outline of argument for the second paper draft. All paper topics will be reviewed in class in advance. In addition, the course has a scheduled three-hour final exam.

No internet sources should be consulted for your papers, other than those which are either primary source collections, or are academically refereed sites. If you are unsure about a site, please consult with one of us prior to using it. If used, all internet sources must be properly footnoted and cited in your bibliography at the end of your paper just as for any other type of source. Plagiarism from any source will not be tolerated. Plagiarism earns an automatic F (0%) for the assignment. Moreover, all cases of plagiarism will be reported to the COD for their consideration of the appropriate disciplinary action to take with the student involved. If you are unsure what plagiarism is please see the MIT Online Writing Communication Center. If you are still uncertain, please see me.
