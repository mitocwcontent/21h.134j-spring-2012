{{< quote "I wanted them to know that teaching all of them, all the time, in the style that they find most amenable was actually impossible." "â€” Prof. McCants" >}}

_In this section, Prof. McCants shares a survey she used on the first day of class._

On the first day of class, I gave my students a survey to complete in class. The survey served three key purposes:

1.  **Giving me a quick overview of the students' needs and backgrounds**
2.  **Helping students see that different students have different needs:** The survey always shows that we have a broad range of students in the class, and I shared these results with the students. I wanted them to know that teaching all of them, all the time, in the style that they find most amenable was actually impossible. I think that a lot of students never realize that what works for them doesn't necessarily work for everybody, and the instructor has an obligation to at least think of everybody.
3.  **Getting the students into the habit of writing:** I wanted the students to actually write something on the first day, even if it was as silly as filling out a survey, because I wanted them to have their pens in their hands and to do something active. It helped to set the tone for the class.

The survey questions are given below. The numbers given in parentheses behind each answer indicate how many of the course's 43 students chose that answer.
